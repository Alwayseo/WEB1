  <h2>Nintendo</h2>
  <p>
  Nintendo Co., Ltd. is a Japanese multinational consumer electronics and video game company headquartered in Kyoto.
  Nintendo is one of the world's largest video game companies by market capitalization, creating some of the best-known and top-selling video game franchises of all-time, such as Mario, The Legend of Zelda, Animal Crossing, and Pok√©mon.
  Nintendo was founded in 1889 by Fusajiro Yamauchi and originally produced handmade hanafuda playing cards.
  By 1963, the company had tried several small niche businesses, such as cab services and love hotels, without major success.
  Abandoning previous ventures in favor of toys in the 1960s, Nintendo developed into a video game company in the 1970s.
  Supplemented since the 1980s by its major divisions Nintendo of America and Nintendo of Europe, it ultimately became one of the most influential in the video game industry and one of Japan's most-valuable companies with a market value of over $37 billion in 2018.
